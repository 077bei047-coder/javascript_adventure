//primitive
//In JavaScript, a primitive (primitive value, primitive data type) is data that is not an object and has no methods or properties.
//All primitives are immutable; that is, they cannot be altered.
//The variable may be reassigned to a new value, but the existing value can not be changed in the ways that objects, arrays, and functions can be altered.
// There are 7 primitive data types:

//string
//number
//bigint
//boolean
//undefined
//symbol
//null

//non primitive or reference types
// They can store collections of values or more complex entities.
//they are:
//Object,Array,functions


//javaScript is a dynamically typed language
//You do not need to declare the data type of a variable.
//The type is decided at runtime, and it can change while the program is running.
